# Unit 2 | Assignment - The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel master! In this assignment you will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabtical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

### Stock market analyst


* Create a script that will loop through one year of stock data for each run and return the total volume each stock had over that year.

* You will also need to display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total stock volume.

* Your result should look as follows (note: all solution images are for 2015 data).

### CHALLENGE

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running it once.



### Other Considerations

* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.

## Submission

* To submit please upload the following to Github:

  * A screen shot for each year of your results on the Multi Year Stock Data.

  * VBA Scripts as separate files.

* After everything has been saved, create a sharable link and submit that to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com/>.
